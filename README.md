Keylogger in Python

To run this on your Windows PC you will need to exclude this file from 'Virus & threat protection'...to do so, go to:

Windows Security -> Virus & threat protection -> Manage settings (under virus & threat protection settings) -> Exclusions (choose the keylogger file) 

Now you can save and run this on your PC without Windows deleting the file.

Keylogger controls: 'Enter' to run, 'Esc' to exit.
